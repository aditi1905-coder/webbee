                <h2>Introduction to JavaScript</h2>
                <p style="font-size:20px">JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on web pages. It is executed on the client-side, meaning it runs within the user's web browser.</p>
                <p  style="font-size:20px">JavaScript plays a crucial role in modern web development, enabling developers to enhance the functionality and interactivity of websites.</p>

                <h2>What Can JavaScript Do?</h2>
                <ul style="font-size:20px">
                    <li><strong>Manipulate HTML and CSS:</strong> JavaScript can dynamically modify the content and styling of HTML elements based on user actions or other events.</li>
                    <li><strong>Handle Events:</strong> JavaScript allows you to define functions that are executed in response to user interactions with the webpage, such as clicks, mouse movements, and form submissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interact with the Document Object Model (DOM):</strong> JavaScript can manipulate the structure, content, and style of HTML documents through the Document Object Model, enabling dynamic updates to web pages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Asynchronous Programming:</strong> JavaScript supports asynchronous operations, allowing it to handle tasks such as fetching data from servers without blocking the execution of other code, leading to more responsive and efficient web applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Build Web Applications:</strong> JavaScript is a key component in building modern web applications, enabling developers to create engaging and interactive user experiences.</li>
                </ul>
